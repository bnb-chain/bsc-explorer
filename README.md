## About BlockScout

BlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.
